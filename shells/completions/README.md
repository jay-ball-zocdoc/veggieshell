# Command Completions

The files in this folder are imported into the shell, in numerical and
alphabetic order, but only for bash v2.05 or newer.   Only the \*.sh and
\*.bash files will be read into bash.

Information on specific files:

* basic-compltions.sh - A small generic set.

* git-completion.bash - Downloaded version from 2013-03-25 from http://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash 

* complete-examples - a non-running set of examples taken from
	the Bash Cookbook at
	http://www.bashcookbook.com/bashinfo/source/base-4.2/examples/complete/complete-examples
	.  This example also works for bash 2.05 and there are
	many more at the Bash Cookbook site.
