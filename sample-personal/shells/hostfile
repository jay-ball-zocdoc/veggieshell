# This file contain all your personal hostnames that you like to go to
# on the command line.  This is used by bash to do "telnet <tab>"
# (bash2.05+) or "mail person@<tab>" (bash2.00+) sorts of things.
# Make this file look like /etc/hosts (which is read first).  This
# file overrides all host an network specific hostname <tab> things.
#
# Bash allows you to have multiple hostfiles that build on one another,
# so it is possible to have host specific hostfiles later.  See
# shells/completions/basic-completions.sh for more info.
