# Scripts folder

This directory contains shell scripts which are distributed as part
of veggieshell.  This is added to the path.

* ansi-colors.sh - helpful for debugging terminal
    coloring.  NOTE: Run this script via the source command:
    `source ansi-colors.sh`; running directly does not
    work properly.
* change-mach-addr.sh - change the MAC address for the wireless
    Ethernet interface to a random address.  Right now, only
    works on OS X, but someone could easily port to other
    systems.
